# (Odin) Library

This project will make use of the knowledge obtained regarding the objects section of the JS course. Within this repo, I shall apply the following knowledge:

  - Creation of objects.
  - Usage of prototypes, including proper assigning of properties, methods, and inheritance.
  - Usage of constructors, properly makign use of the `this` keyword to avoid scope issues.
  - Revisit DOM manipulation, as well as HTML forms.
  - Give it my own twist, even if small!!
